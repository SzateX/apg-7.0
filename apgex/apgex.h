\anchor apgex_anchor_intro
### Introduction
`apgex` is a regex-like pattern-matching engine which uses SABNF as the pattern-defining syntax and
APG as the pattern-matching parser.
While regex has a long and storied history and is heavily integrated into modern programming languages and practice,
`apgex` offers the full pattern-matching power of APG and the reader-friendly SABNF syntax.
It is fully recursive, meaning nested parenthesis matching,
and introduces a new [parent mode of back referencing](\ref parent_mode), enabling,
for example, the matching of names in nested start and end HTML tags.

Though not specifically designed and built to address the `regex` issues discussed [here by Larry Wall](https://raku.org/archive/doc/design/apo/A05.html),
creator of the Perl language, `apgex` does seem to go a long way toward addressing many of those issues.
Most notably back referencing and nested patterns, but other issues as well.

First introduced in JavaScript APG
[[1]](https://github.com/ldthomas/apg-js2-exp)
[[2]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apg-exp)
 as an alternative to
[RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) in 2017,
this extends it to the C-language and the updated APG version 7.0.
The full documentation can be found in the files apgex.h and apgex.c.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_const
### Construction/Destruction
`apgex` follows the [object](\ref object_model) model of APG.
Pattern-matching objects are created and destroyed with the constructor and destructor functions,
 - \ref vpApgexCtor()
 - \ref vApgexDtor().

[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_pattern
### Defining the SABNF Pattern
There are three functions for defining the SABNF pattern.
The `apgex` pattern-matching parser can be generated on the fly from an SABNF pattern string or file
or from a previously constructed SABNF grammar parser.
  - From a pattern string \ref vApgexPattern()<br>
  A valid SABNF grammar is simply defined in a null-terminated string and used to define the pattern.
  - From a pattern file \ref vApgexPatternFile()<br>
  Same as above, but the SABNF grammar exists in a file rather than a string.
  - From a previously constructed parser \ref vApgexPatternParser()<br>
  An APG parser object may be created in advance elsewhere in the application and used here
  to define the pattern. Any method can be used to generate the parser in advance -
  from an APG-generated file or on the fly from the APG API.

[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_config
### Configuring the Pattern Parser
`apgex` offers several ways to configure the pattern-matching parser prior to execution.
 - flags - See vApgexPattern() for a complete discussion of the available flag options
 and their effect on the operation of the parser.
 - vApgexEnableRules() - `apgex` has the ability to capture the sub-phrases matched by the individual
 SABNF grammr rules and UDTs. By default, all such capture is disabled.
 Use this function to enable or disable any or all rules and UDTs.
 - vApgexDefineUDT() - If there are any UDTs in the SABNF pattern grammar they must have callback functions assigned
 prior to any phrase-matching attempt. Use this function to define them.
 - vApgexSetLastIndex() - See the discussion of flags in vApgexPattern() for an explanation of the
 default values and use of `uiLastIndex`. The default values can be overridden prior to any phrase-matching attempt
 with this function.
 - sApgexProperties() - If special configuration of the tracing object is needed,
 the properties includes a pointer to the trace object. See vTraceConfig() for details.
 If the AST is requested it may need to be configured before use.
 The properties includes a pointer to the AST object. See \ref ast.c for details.

[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_exec
### Execution
Once the `apgex` object is constructed and the pattern has been defined and configured,
the search for a matched phrase must be executed.
There are four functions which will execute a search. These will be discussed individually in the next four sub-sections.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_find
#### Finding a Matched Phrase
 sApgexExec()<br>
 This is the primary execution function which will
 generate detailed information about the matched phrase if successful.
 The results include, in addition to the matched phrase, the "left context", the "right context"
 and the sub-phrases captured for each of the enabled rule/UDT names.
 For a detailed description of the results, see the \ref apgex_result structure.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_test
#### Test for a Matched Phrase
 bApgexTest()<br>
 This will execute the parse just the same as sApgexExec() except that no matched phrases are captured.
 The return is simply `true` if a match is found and `false` if not.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_replace
#### Replace the Matched Phrase
 sApgexReplace() and sApgexReplaceFunc()<br>
 This will perform a phrase match similar to sApgexExec() except that instead of returning the matched phrase,
 the source string is returned with the matched phrase replaced by the defined replacement string.
 There is considerable flexibility in the definition of the replacement string.
 Anything from a simple string, a string that includes phrases from the matched results, or even
 a user-defined function with full access to the result and the current state properties.
 See the function descriptions for details.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_split
#### Split - Matched Phrases as Delimiters
spApgexSplit()<br>
 * This function is modeled after the JavaScript function
 * [str.split([separator[, limit]])](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
 * when using a regular expression.
 It will use the matched phrases as delimiters to split the input, source string into an array of sub-strings.
 See the function description for details.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_props
### Properties
Properties are the current state of the `apgex` object. In addition to the last phrase match, if any,
there are the flags, the original input string and SABNF grammar,
pointers to the parser, trace and AST object contexts and other information.
See the \ref apgex_properties structure for the properties details.
Use sApgexProperties() to get a copy of the properties.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_trace
### Trace - the Debugger
When a phrase match doesn't go as expected the problem could be an SABNF grammar error, an error in the input source string
or both. The primary debugging tool is a trace &ndash; a detailed map of the parser's path through the parser tree
with a display of the results for each tree node visit. APG provides just such a tool and it can be activated for the
phrase-matching parser. This is done by simply specifying the "t" or "th" flags and defining the macro APG_TRACE when compiling the application.
Use vpApgexGetTrace() to get a pointer to the trace object's context.
This pointer can then be used to configure the trace. See vTraceConfig()<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_ast
### Abstract Syntax Tree - the Matched Phrase AST
It may be that a more complex translation of the matched phrases is needed than that provided by the
[replacement functions.](\ref apgex_anchor_replace)
The AST is the ultimate translation tool as discussed in the [library](\ref library) section.
The full capabilities of the AST library are available for the translation or manipulation of the matched phrases.
Use vpApgexGetAst() to get a pointer to the AST object's context.<br>
[&uarr;top](\ref apgex_anchor_top)

\anchor apgex_anchor_display
### Display Helpers
The matched results and properties have a lot of information &ndash;
sometimes in lists, and even in lists of lists. `apgex` offers three display helpers for a quick, easy look this data.
Phrases and other strings of alphabet characters are displayed as simple, ASCII strings if possible.
If they contain non-ASCII characters a [format object](\ref utils) is used for a hexadecimal display.
 - vApgexDisplayResult() - a quick look at the matched result.
 - vApgexDisplayProperties() - a quick look at the object properties.
 - vApgexDisplayPhrase() - a quick look at a single `apgex` phrase.
