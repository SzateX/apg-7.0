# NOTE 1) All keys and values are case sensitive including the "rule:" and "UDT:" prefixes.
#         However, rule and UDT names are case insensitive
# NOTE 2) true may be represented by true or t or 1
#         false may be represented by false or f or 0
# NOTE 3) Lines beginning with # (0x23) or white space (0x09, 0x0A, 0x0D or 0x20) are ignored.
# NOTE 4) Missing keys assume the listed default values.
# NOTE 5) Unrecognized keys and values will result in error messages and a thrown exception.

#
# If "PPPT" is true the Partially-Predictive Parsing Table (PPPT) form of output will be used.
# The PPPT form indicates when a predictive table value was used in place of an opcode.
# If no PPPT data is available "PPPT" is automatically set to false.
# "PPPT" defaults to true if PPPT data is available, false otherwise.

#
# If "count-only" is true, only a count of the total number of records is displayed.
# The printing of individual records is suppressed.
# Handy for a first run on large grammars or input strings.
# It can help in setting the "first-record" and "max-records" parameters.

#
# "first-record" sets the record number of the first record to display.
# Records prior are not displayed. Default = 0.

# "max-records" sets the maximum number of records to display.
# If 0, the maximum number of records is set to APG_MAX_AINT. Default = 0.

# Set the opcodes to be displayed individually.
