3.3.15.  Unacceptable Accept Offering

   This request indicates that the response must contain a body in an
   unknown type.  In particular, since the Accept header field does not
   contain application/sdp, the response may not contain an SDP body.
   The recipient of this request could respond with a 406 Not
   Acceptable, with a Warning/399 indicating that a response cannot be
   formulated in the formats offered in the Accept header field.  It is
   also appropriate to respond with a 400 Bad Request, since all SIP
   User-Agents (UAs) supporting INVITE are required to support
   application/sdp.
