3.3.7.  Unknown Authorization Scheme

   This REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field with an
   unknown scheme.  The request is well formed.  A parser must not fail
   when receiving it.

   A proxy will treat this request as it would any other REGISTER.  If
   it forwards the request, it will include this Authorization header
   field unmodified in the forwarded messages.

   A registrar that does not care about challenge-response
   authentication will simply ignore the Authorization header field,
   processing this registration as if the field were not present.  A
   registrar that does care about challenge-response authentication will
   reject this request with a 401, issuing a new challenge with a scheme
   it understands.

   Endpoints choosing not to act as registrars will simply reject the
   request.  A 405 Method Not Allowed is appropriate.
