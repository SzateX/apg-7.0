3.3.4.  Unknown URI Schemes in Header Fields

   This message contains registered schemes in the To, From, and Contact
   header fields of a request.  The message is syntactically valid.
   Parsers must not fail when receiving this message.

   Proxies should treat this message as they would any other request for
   this URI.  A registrar would reject this request with a 400 Bad
   Request response, since the To: header field is required to contain a
   SIP or SIPS URI as an AOR.
