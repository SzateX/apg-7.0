3.3.12.  REGISTER with a Contact Header Parameter

   This register request contains a contact where the 'unknownparam'
   parameter must be interpreted as a contact-param and not a url-param.

   This REGISTER should succeed.  The response must not include
   "unknownparam" as a url-parameter for this binding.  Likewise,
   "unknownparam" must not appear as a url-parameter in any binding
   during subsequent fetches.

   Behavior is the same, of course, for any known contact-param
   parameter names.
