3.3.13.  REGISTER with a url-parameter

   This register request contains a contact where the URI has an unknown
   parameter.

   The register should succeed, and a subsequent retrieval of the
   registration must include "unknownparam" as a url-parameter.

   Behavior is the same, of course, for any known url-parameter names.
