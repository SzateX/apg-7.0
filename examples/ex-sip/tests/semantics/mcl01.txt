3.3.9.  Multiple Content-Length Values

   Multiple conflicting Content-Length header field values appear in
   this request.

   From a framing perspective, this situation is equivalent to an
   invalid Content-Length value (or no value at all).

   An element receiving this message should respond with an error.  This
   request appeared over UDP, so the remainder of the datagram can
   simply be discarded.  If a request like this arrives over TCP, the
   framing error is not recoverable, and the connection should be
   closed.
