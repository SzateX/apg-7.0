3.3.11.  Max-Forwards of Zero

   This is a legal SIP request with the Max-Forwards header field value
   set to zero.

   A proxy should not forward the request and should respond 483 (Too
   Many Hops).  An endpoint should process the request as if the Max-
   Forwards field value were still positive.
