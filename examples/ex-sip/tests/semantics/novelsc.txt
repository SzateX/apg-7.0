3.3.3.  Request-URI with Known but Atypical Scheme

   This OPTIONS contains an Request-URI with an IANA-registered scheme
   that does not commonly appear in Request-URIs of SIP requests.  A
   parser must accept this as a well-formed SIP request.

   If an element will never accept this scheme as meaningful in a
   Request-URI, it is appropriate to treat it as unknown and return a
   416 Unsupported URI Scheme response.  If the element might accept
   some URIs with this scheme, then a 404 Not Found is appropriate for
   those URIs it doesn't accept.
