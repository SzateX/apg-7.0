3.3.10.  200 OK Response with Broadcast Via Header Field Value

   This message is a response with a 2nd Via header field value's sent-
   by containing 255.255.255.255.  The message is well formed; parsers
   must not fail when receiving it.

   Per [RFC3261], an endpoint receiving this message should simply
   discard it.

   If a proxy followed normal response processing rules blindly, it
   would forward this response to the broadcast address.  To protect
   against this as an avenue of attack, proxies should drop such
   responses.
