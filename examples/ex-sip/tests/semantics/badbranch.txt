3.2.1.  Missing Transaction Identifier

   This request indicates support for RFC 3261-style transaction
   identifiers by providing the z9hG4bK prefix to the branch parameter,
   but it provides no identifier.  A parser must not break when
   receiving this message.  An element receiving this request could
   reject the request with a 400 Response (preferably statelessly, as
   other requests from the source are likely also to have a malformed
   branch parameter), or it could fall back to the RFC 2543-style
   transaction identifier.
