3.3.2.  Request-URI with Unknown Scheme

   This OPTIONS contains an unknown URI scheme in the Request-URI.  A
   parser must accept this as a well-formed SIP request.

   An element receiving this request will reject it with a 416
   Unsupported URI Scheme response.

   Some early implementations attempt to look at the contents of the To
   header field to determine how to route this kind of request.  That is
   an error.  Despite the fact that the To header field and the Request
   URI frequently look alike in simplistic first-hop messages, the To
   header field contains no routing information.
