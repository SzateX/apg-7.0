3.1.2.1.  Extraneous Header Field Separators

   The Via header field of this request contains additional semicolons
   and commas without parameters or values.  The Contact header field
   contains additional semicolons without parameters.  This message is
   syntactically invalid.

   An element receiving this request should respond with a 400 Bad
   Request error.

      It is interesting how the Via fails. The Via itself is accepted as
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.15
      The failure is finding ";" instead of CRLF after that.
      
      The parser never actually gets to the Contact header. The entire
      message fails so badly from the ";;,;,," following Via that it
      gives up the fight.
