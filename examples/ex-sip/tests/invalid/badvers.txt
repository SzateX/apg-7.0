   to its high version number.

   Supported error.

      The parse succeeds. The message is syntactically correct.
      From RFC 3261
           "To be compliant with this specification,
           applications sending SIP messages MUST include a SIP-Version
           of "SIP/2.0".  The SIP-Version string is case-insensitive,
           but implementations MUST send upper-case."

      SIP-Version       =  "SIP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
      Constraints on the version number would have to be semantically enforced.
