3.1.2.6.  Unterminated Quoted String in Display Name

   This is a request with an unterminated quote in the display name of
   the To field.  An element receiving this request should return a 400
   Bad Request error.

   An element could attempt to infer a terminating quote and accept the
   message.  Such an element needs to take care that it makes a
   reasonable inference when it encounters

      To: "Mr J. User <sip:j.user@example.com> <sip:realj@example.net>

      Message Details : quotbal
      
      NOTE: LDT: 01/04/2021
      The parse succeeds. The message is syntactically correct.
      The To: header does indeed fail. The liberal extension-header
      accepts it OK.
