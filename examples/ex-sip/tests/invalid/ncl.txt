3.1.2.3.  Negative Content-Length

   This request has a negative value for Content-Length.

   An element receiving this message should respond with an error.  This
   request appeared over UDP, so the remainder of the datagram can
   simply be discarded.  If a request like this arrives over TCP, the
   framing error is not recoverable, and the connection should be
   closed.  The same behavior is appropriate for messages that arrive
   without a numeric value in the Content-Length header field, such as
   the following:

      Content-Length: five

   Implementors should take extra precautions if the technique they
   choose for converting this ascii field into an integral form can
   return a negative value.  In particular, the result must not be used
   as a counter or array index.

      The parse succeeds. The message is syntactically correct.
      Content-Length does indeed fail. But the liberal extension-header
      picks it up OK.
