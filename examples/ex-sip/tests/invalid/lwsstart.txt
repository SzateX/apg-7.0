3.1.2.9.  Multiple SP Separating Request-Line Elements

   This INVITE has illegal multiple SP characters between elements of
   the start line.

   It is acceptable to reject this request as malformed.  An element
   that is liberal in what it accepts may ignore these extra SP
   characters when processing the request.  If the element forwards the
   request, it must not include these extra SP characters in the
   messages it sends.

      Fails as expected. Fails immediately at the second SP after the Method.
