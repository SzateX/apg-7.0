3.1.2.8.  Malformed SIP Request-URI (embedded LWS)

   This INVITE has illegal LWS within the Request-URI.

   An element receiving this request should respond with a 400 Bad
   Request.

   An element could attempt to ignore the embedded LWS for those schemes
   (like SIP) where doing so would not introduce ambiguity.

      NOTE: LDT: 01/04/2021
      Fails as expected. Fails immediately at the missing SP
      after the Request-URI.
