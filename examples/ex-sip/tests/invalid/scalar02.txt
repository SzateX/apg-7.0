3.1.2.4.  Request Scalar Fields with Overlarge Values

   This request contains several scalar header field values outside
   their legal range.

      o  The CSeq sequence number is >2**32-1.

      o  The Max-Forwards value is >255.

      o  The Expires value is >2**32-1.

      o  The Contact expires parameter value is >2**32-1.

   An element receiving this request should respond with a 400 Bad
   Request due to the CSeq error.  If only the Max-Forwards field were
   in error, the element could choose to process the request as if the
   field were absent.  If only the expiry values were in error, the
   element could treat them as if they contained the default values for
   expiration (3600 in this case).

   Other scalar request fields that may contain aberrant values include,
   but are not limited to, the Contact q value, the Timestamp value, and
   the Via ttl parameter.
