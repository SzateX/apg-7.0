3.1.2.18.  Unknown Method with CSeq Method Mismatch

   This message has an unknown method in the start line, and a CSeq
   method tag that does not match.

   Implemented.  A 400 Bad Request is also acceptable, but choosing a
   501 (particularly at proxies) has better future-proof
   characteristics.
