3.1.2.10.  SP Characters at End of Request-Line

   This OPTIONS request contains SP characters between the SIP-Version
   field and the CRLF terminating the Request-Line.

   It is acceptable to reject this request as malformed.  An element
   that is liberal in what it accepts may ignore these extra SP
   characters when processing the request.  If the element forwards the
   request, it must not include these extra SP characters in the
   messages it sends.

      Fails as expected. Fails immediately at the SP following the
      SIP-Version.
