3.1.2.15.  Non-token Characters in Display Name

   This OPTIONS request is malformed, since the display names in the To
   and From header fields contain non-token characters but are unquoted.

   It is reasonable always to reject this kind of error with a 400 Bad
   Request response.

   An element may attempt to be liberal in what it receives and infer
   the missing quotes.  If this element were a proxy, it must not
   propagate the error into the request it forwards.  As a consequence,
   if the fields are covered by a signature, there's not much point in
   trying to be liberal - the message should simply be rejected.

      TO and From fail as expected on the non-token comma.
      However, the extension-header picks them up OK.
      This message fails because it is missing the final CRLF at the end.
