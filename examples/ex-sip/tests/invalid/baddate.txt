3.1.2.12.  Invalid Time Zone in Date Header Field

   This INVITE is invalid, as it contains a non-GMT time zone in the SIP
   Date header field.

   It is acceptable to reject this request as malformed (though an
   element shouldn't do that unless the contents of the Date header
   field were actually important to its processing).  An element wishing
   to be liberal in what it accepts could ignore this value altogether
   if it wasn't going to use the Date header field anyway.  Otherwise,
   it could attempt to interpret this date and adjust it to GMT.

   RFC 3261 explicitly defines the only acceptable time zone designation
   as "GMT".  "UT", while synonymous with GMT per [RFC2822], is not
   valid.  "UTC" and "UCT" are also invalid.

      NOTE: LDT: 01/04/2021
      The parse succeeds. The message is syntactically correct.

      Date fails as expected. However, as with other invalid messages
      when such a header fails, the extension-header picks it up OK.
