3.1.2.2.  Content Length Larger Than Message

   This is a request message with a Content Length that is larger than
   the actual length of the body.

   When sent over UDP (as this message ostensibly was), the receiving
   element should respond with a 400 Bad Request error.  If this message
   arrived over a stream-based transport, such as TCP, there's not much
   the receiving party could do but wait for more data on the stream and
   close the connection if none is forthcoming within a reasonable
   period of time.
