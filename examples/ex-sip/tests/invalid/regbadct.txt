3.1.2.13.  Failure to Enclose name-addr URI in <>

   This REGISTER request is malformed.  The SIP URI contained in the
   Contact Header field has an escaped header, so the field must be in
   name-addr form (which implies that the URI must be enclosed in <>).

   It is reasonable for an element receiving this request to respond
   with a 400 Bad Request.  An element choosing to be liberal in what it
   accepts could infer the angle brackets since there is no ambiguity in
   this example.  In general, that won't be possible.

      The parse succeeds. The message is syntactically correct.
      Actually escaped characters are accepted in SIP-URI headers.
      headers           =  "?" header *( "&" header )
      header            =  hname "=" hvalue
      hname             =  1*( hnv-unreserved / unreserved / escaped )
      hvalue            =  *( hnv-unreserved / unreserved / escaped )
      hnv-unreserved    =  "[" / "]" / "/" / "?" / ":" / "+" / "$"
