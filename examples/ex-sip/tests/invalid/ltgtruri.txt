3.1.2.7.  <> Enclosing Request-URI

   This INVITE request is invalid because the Request-URI has been
   enclosed within in "<>".

   It is reasonable always to reject a request with this error with a
   400 Bad Request.  Elements attempting to be liberal with what they
   accept may choose to ignore the brackets.  If the element forwards
   the request, it must not include the brackets in the messages it
   sends.

      Fails as expected.
