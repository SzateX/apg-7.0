3.1.2.14.  Spaces within addr-spec

   This request is malformed, since the addr-spec in the To header field
   contains spaces.  Parsers receiving this request must not break.  It
   is reasonable to reject this request with a 400 Bad Request response.
   Elements attempting to be liberal may ignore the spaces.

      The parse succeeds.
      
      The "To" header does indeed fail, but the message-header:
      /  header-name                HCOLON extension-header) CRLF
      does succeed.
      
      The extension-header allows almost anything and will usually succeed,
      even if the "To" header fails. The application would have to handle
      this in semantics.
