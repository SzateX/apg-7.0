3.1.2.11.  Escaped Headers in SIP Request-URI

   This INVITE is malformed, as the SIP Request-URI contains escaped
   headers.
   
   It is acceptable for an element to reject this request with a 400 Bad
   Request.  An element could choose to be liberal in what it accepts
   and ignore the escaped headers.  If the element is a proxy, the
   escaped headers must not appear in the Request-URI of the forwarded
   request (and most certainly must not be translated into the actual
   header of the forwarded request).

      NOTE: LDT: 01/04/2021
      The parse succeeds. The message is syntactically correct.

      Escaped characters actually are allowed. The ABNF in RFC 3261 is

      headers         =  "?" header *( "&" header )
      header          =  hname "=" hvalue
      hname           =  1*( hnv-unreserved / unreserved / escaped )
      hvalue          =  *( hnv-unreserved / unreserved / escaped )
      hnv-unreserved  =  "[" / "]" / "/" / "?" / ":" / "+" / "$"
