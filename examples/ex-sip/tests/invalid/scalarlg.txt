3.1.2.5.  Response Scalar Fields with Overlarge Values

   This response contains several scalar header field values outside
   their legal range.

   o  The CSeq sequence number is >2**32-1.

   o  The Retry-After field is unreasonably large (note that RFC 3261
      does not define a legal range for this field).

   o  The Warning field has a warning-value with more than 3 digits.

   An element receiving this response will simply discard it.

      The parse succeeds. The message is syntactically correct.
      The Warning header does indeed fail. 
      But then the liberal extension-header accepts it.
      This would require some error productions to catch this syntactically.
