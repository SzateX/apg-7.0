3.1.1.8.  Extra Trailing Octets in a UDP Datagram

   This message contains a single SIP REGISTER request, which ostensibly
   arrived over UDP in a single datagram.  The packet contains extra
   octets after the body (which in this case has zero length).  The
   extra octets happen to look like a SIP INVITE request, but (per
   section 18.3 of [RFC3261]) they are just spurious noise that must be
   ignored.

   A SIP element receiving this datagram would handle the REGISTER
   request normally and ignore the extra bits that look like an INVITE
   request.  If the element is a proxy choosing to forward the REGISTER,
   the INVITE octets would not appear in the forwarded request.
