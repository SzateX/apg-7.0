3.1.1.5.  Use of % When It Is Not an Escape

   In most of the places % can appear in a SIP message, it is not an
   escape character.  This can surprise the unwary implementor.  The
   following well-formed request has these properties:

   o  The request method is unknown.  It is NOT equivalent to REGISTER.

   o  The display name portion of the To and From header fields is
      "%Z%45".  Note that this is not the same as %ZE.

   o  This message has two Contact header field values, not three.
      <sip:alias2@host2.example.com> is a C%6Fntact header field value.

   A parser should accept this message as well formed.  A proxy would
   forward or reject the message depending on what the Request-URI meant
   to it.  An endpoint would reject this message with a 501.

      The request method is accepted.
      "%Z%45" is accepted as a quoted-string, display name in both the
      To: and From: fields.
      The two Contact headers are accepted as expected.
      The C%6Fntact field is accepted as the nearly all-inclusive
      extension-header.
