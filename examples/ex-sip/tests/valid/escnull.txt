3.1.1.4.  Escaped Nulls in URIs

   This register request contains several URIs with nulls in the
   userpart.  The message is well formed - parsers must accept this
   message.  Implementations must take special care when unescaping the
   Address-of-Record (AOR) in this request so as to not prematurely
   shorten the username.  This request registers two distinct contact
   URIs.
