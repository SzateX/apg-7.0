3.1.1.3.  Valid Use of the % Escaping Mechanism

   This INVITE exercises the % HEX HEX escaping mechanism in several
   places.  The request is syntactically valid.  Interesting features
   include the following:

   o  The request-URI has sips:user@example.com embedded in its
      userpart.  What that might mean to example.net is beyond the scope
      of this document.

   o  The From and To URIs have escaped characters in their userparts.

   o  The Contact URI has escaped characters in the URI parameters.
      Note that the "name" uri-parameter has a value of "value%41",
      which is NOT equivalent to "valueA".  Per [RFC3986], unescaping
      URI components is never performed recursively.

   A parser must accept this as a well-formed message.  The application
   using the message must treat the % HEX HEX expansions as equivalent
   to the character being encoded.  The application must not try to
   interpret % as an escape character in those places where % HEX HEX
   ("escaped" in the grammar) is not a valid part of the construction.
   In [RFC3261], "escaped" only occurs in the expansions of SIP-URI,
   SIPS-URI, and Reason-Phrase.

      Parses as expected.
