3.1.1.1.  A Short Tortuous INVITE

   This short, relatively human-readable message contains:

   o  line folding all over.

   o  escaped characters within quotes.

   o  an empty subject.

   o  LWS between colons, semicolons, header field values, and other
      fields.

   o  both comma separated and separately listed header field values.

   o  a mix of short and long form for the same header field name.

   o  unknown Request-URI parameter.

   o  unknown header fields.

   o  an unknown header field with a value that would be syntactically
      invalid if it were defined in terms of generic-param.

   o  unusual header field ordering.

   o  unusual header field name character case.

   o  unknown parameters of a known header field.

   o  a uri parameter with no value.

   o  a header parameter with no value.

   o  integer fields (Max-Forwards and CSeq) with leading zeros.

   All elements should treat this as a well-formed request.

   The UnknownHeaderWithUnusualValue header field deserves special
   attention.  If this header field were defined in terms of comma-
   separated values with semicolon-separated parameters (as would many
   of the existing defined header fields), this would be invalid.
   However, since the receiving element does not know the definition of
   the syntax for this field, it must parse it as a header value.
   Proxies would forward this header field unchanged.  Endpoints would
   ignore the header field.

      Both the NewFangledHeader and the UnknownHeaderWithUnusualValue
      parse as extension-header.
      Parses as expected.
