3.1.1.13.  Empty Reason Phrase

   This well-formed response contains no reason phrase.  A parser must
   accept this message.  The space character after the reason code is
   required.  If it were not present, this message could be rejected as
   invalid (a liberal receiver would accept it anyway).
