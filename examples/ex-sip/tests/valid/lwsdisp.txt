3.1.1.6.  Message with No LWS between Display Name and <

   This OPTIONS request is not valid per the grammar in RFC 3261 since
   there is no LWS between the token in the display name and < in the
   From header field value.  This has been identified as a specification
   bug that will be removed when RFC 3261 is revised.  Elements should
   accept this request as well formed.
