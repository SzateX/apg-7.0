3.1.1.8.  Extra Trailing Octets in a UDP Datagram

   This message contains a single SIP REGISTER request, which ostensibly
   arrived over UDP in a single datagram.  The packet contains extra
   octets after the body (which in this case has zero length).  The
   extra octets happen to look like a SIP INVITE request, but (per
   section 18.3 of [RFC3261]) they are just spurious noise that must be
   ignored.

   A SIP element receiving this datagram would handle the REGISTER
   request normally and ignore the extra bits that look like an INVITE
   request.  If the element is a proxy choosing to forward the REGISTER,
   the INVITE octets would not appear in the forwarded request.

      This is an added test. It is the same as 3.1.1.8 except
      the domainlabel has been modified to include several cases of hyphens.
      Testing that the ABNF
      domainlabel       =  1*alphanum *(1*"-" 1*alphanum)
      performs as expected.
      
      domainlable in
      REGISTER sip:example---1-a---A.com SIP/2.0
      Parses as expected.
      
      domainlabel in
      REGISTER sip:example---1-a---A-.com SIP/2.0
      The parse fails.
