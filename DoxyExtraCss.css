 The clear-left class can be used to clear a left-floating graph
 and remove the text wrapping. However, you must use the \htmlonly tag
 or Doxygen will ignore any class you put in a <p> tag
 (or any other tag, for that matter.)
 Also, no end tag, </p>, is needed. Doxygen will supply it.
 e. g. 
 \htmlonly
 <p class="clear-left">
 \endhtmlonly
